# Cancer
Cancer Data by State
This Python project is designed to pull cancer data, more specifically breast cancer data and analyze the number of cases within a specifi state. The project
allows the user to input specifc states to pull data they would like to see plotted in Matplotlib. 
  1) Project is specifically named and uploaded in GitHub with a minimum of 5 separate commits
  2) A README file with at least one paragraph explaining the project 
  3) Relevant packages to be installed to run the project include:
     Anaconda with Jupyter Notebooks 
     Coding was performed using:
     Visual Studio Code
     Python   3.10.
     Jupyter - extension for Visual Studio Code
  4) Data used within this project includes an Excel spreadsheet that contains several columns of cancer data by states.
     Features include:

   A) Feature 1 - Read data using Pandas in from a local Excel file. 
      Import Pandas and Numpy for data analysis and to read the Excel file. Matplotlib imported to plot the data.
   B) Feature 2 -Cleaning the data - using isnull to check for any cells that have null values, replaced cells that contain the vulue of b with a value 
      of 0 to ensure the columns specific to cancer data contain numbers for analysis purposes.
   C) Feature 3 - Data discovery; mean (average) of the breast cancer cases, total number of breast cancer cases, include an input so user can pull the 
      sum of any column, description of the dataframe, the median of the total breast cancer cases and the total rows for column breast cancer. 
   D) Feature 4 - Using Matplotlib to plot all states breast cancer cases, allowing user to input specific state and plot that data.(Please note when using 
      the input feature please captialize the states, the code will not work if the state is not capitalized.)
   E) Feature 5 - Jupyter Notebook markdown cells to explain the requirements included in the project.
